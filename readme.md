### Atoms
First, you'll break your UI into the smallest low-level native wrappers. These are custom UI wrappers around native components. For instance, you could have a generic button component. It will be a higher-order component and will conditionally render the TouchableOpacity, TouchableHighlight, or Button component using props.

After this point, you'll never want to directly use the above native components to build UIs. You'll use your custom button component.

### Molecules
Next, you'll use your atoms to create molecules! In other words, you'll use your custom button component to create different buttons. Maybe you'll have a different button for your login form and another button for redirecting to the signup form.

These components may or may not be completely reusable. But they should be rendered reusable on at least more than one page of your application.

### Organisms
Finally, you'll use your molecules or molecules and atoms to build organisms! You'll use the above components to build screens and pages.

For instance, you can use your login form and login buttons to create the entire login page. Your organisms are not intended for reusability, but if you can reuse them, kudos to you!
